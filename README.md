# LongestCommonSubsequence
In this program I have written code to calculate the length of the longest common subsequence.
The difference between the subsequence and substring is that substring needs to be continuous and subsequence does not.

This program can be solved with three approaches which are Recursion, Memoization and Dynamic Programming.

To understand the problem statement and to know the algorithm better I suggest
you to go through this video and then all of your doubts will be cleared.

After that you can have a look at my code or even try it by yourself.
